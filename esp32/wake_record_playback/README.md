# ESP32 wake-word local AI client

This Arduino sketch targets the ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85C V1 pinout used by
`speaker_mic_test` and `audio_out_no_tf`. It detects **Hi ESP** locally, records
16 kHz mono PCM, sends it over Wi-Fi to the Python bridge, and streams the
Piper WAV response to the PCM5101 speaker. After each answer it listens for a
follow-up for eight seconds, so the wake phrase is only needed to start a new
conversation.

The computer pipeline is:

```text
ESP32 WakeNet -> PCM/HTTP -> faster-whisper -> Ollama -> Piper -> WAV/HTTP -> ESP32
```

## Start the computer bridge

From the voice assistant project, load the existing environment and run:

```bash
cd "/home/dq/Local _Voice_Assistant/voice_assistant"
source .venv/bin/activate
set -a
source .env
set +a
python -m app.esp32_server
```

The bridge listens on TCP port 8765. Test it locally with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
```

Allow TCP port 8765 through the computer firewall if one is enabled. Ollama
can remain bound to `127.0.0.1`; only this bridge needs to be reachable by the
ESP32.

## Configure Wi-Fi

Copy `secrets.example.h` to `secrets.h`, then set the Wi-Fi credentials and the
computer's LAN address:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "your-wifi-name"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-wifi-password"
#define VOICE_SERVER_URL "http://192.168.1.100:8765/v1/conversation"
```

Do not use `127.0.0.1` in the sketch: on the ESP32 that address means the ESP32
itself. Keep `secrets.h` private.

## Detailed Arduino IDE setup

The ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85C has **16 MB flash and 8 MB OPI PSRAM**. Do not
select a 4 MB or 8 MB flash configuration for this board.

### 1. Install or update the Espressif board package

1. In Arduino IDE, open **File > Preferences**.
2. In **Additional Boards Manager URLs**, add:

   `https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json`

   Keep any URLs already present and separate multiple URLs with commas.
3. Open **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**.
4. Search for `esp32`.
5. Install or update **esp32 by Espressif Systems**. Waveshare specifies version
   3.0.2 or newer for this board. A current stable 3.x release contains the
   `ESP_I2S` and `ESP_SR` libraries used by this sketch.
6. Restart Arduino IDE after installing or updating the package.

No separate Library Manager installation is needed for `ESP_SR`; it is supplied
by the Espressif board package. A compile error such as `ESP_SR.h: No such file
or directory` normally means the wrong or an old ESP32 board package is active.

### 2. Select the board and flash settings

Connect the board over USB, then set:

- **Tools > Board**: select the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85C entry if it
  is available. With board packages that do not list it, use
  **ESP32S3 Dev Module**.
- **Tools > Port**: select the port that appears when the board is connected.
- **Tools > Flash Size**: **16MB (128Mb)**.
- **Tools > PSRAM**: **OPI PSRAM**. On versions that only show Enabled/Disabled,
  select **Enabled**.
- **Tools > Partition Scheme**:
  **ESP SR 16M (3MB APP/7MB SPIFFS/2.9MB MODEL)**.
- **Tools > USB CDC On Boot**: **Enabled**, if this option is present. This makes
  `Serial` output available through the native USB connection.

The ESP-SR partition is essential: it contains a dedicated `model` partition
where the build system uploads the WakeNet model. A normal 16 MB partition
scheme has enough total flash but does not necessarily contain that model
partition.

After changing the partition scheme, it is safest to set **Tools > Erase All
Flash Before Sketch Upload > Enabled** for the first upload. Upload once, then
return this setting to **Disabled** to avoid erasing flash on every upload.

If **ESP SR 16M** is absent, check all three of these conditions:

1. **ESP32S3 Dev Module** or the correct Waveshare S3 board is selected—not a
   classic ESP32, ESP32-C3, or ESP32-S2.
2. **Flash Size** is set to 16 MB.
3. `esp32 by Espressif Systems` is updated to a current 3.x release and Arduino
   IDE has been restarted.

### 3. Confirm that PSRAM works

The sketch allocates about 256 KB for eight seconds of mono recording. During
startup it calls `psramFound()`. Open **Tools > Serial Monitor**, select
**115200 baud**, and reset the board.

Correct startup continues past the PSRAM check. If it prints:

`PSRAM is required. Enable it in Arduino Tools > PSRAM.`

then recheck that **OPI PSRAM** is selected. If the board continuously reboots,
also verify **Flash Size = 16MB** and that the selected board target is an
ESP32-S3.

### 4. Find the microphone's active I2S channel

Before uploading the wake-word sketch:

1. Open `esp32/speaker_mic_test/speaker_mic_test.ino`.
2. Keep the same board, flash, PSRAM, and port selections.
3. Upload the microphone test.
4. Open Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**.
5. Stay quiet for a few readings, then speak or tap gently near the microphone.

The monitor prints lines similar to:

```text
L level=120 peak=850 | R level=2 peak=10
L level=940 peak=6200 | R level=2 peak=12
```

In this example the **left** values increase strongly, so leave this setting in
`wake_record_playback.ino`:

```cpp
constexpr bool MIC_IS_LEFT_CHANNEL = true;
```

If the right level and peak increase while the left side stays near zero,
change it to:

```cpp
constexpr bool MIC_IS_LEFT_CHANNEL = false;
```

Use the channel that reacts consistently to your voice. Absolute numbers are
less important than the change between a quiet room and speaking. WakeNet will
usually never trigger if the inactive channel is selected.

### 5. Upload and operate the AI client

Start the Python bridge first. Open `wake_record_playback.ino`, upload it, and
use a 115200-baud serial monitor. Say **Hi ESP**, wait for `Speak now`, speak,
and pause. The recording ends after about 0.9 seconds of silence. The computer
transcribes it, asks Ollama, synthesizes an answer, and sends the WAV back.

Expected serial output is approximately:

```text
Starting wake-word record/playback...
Ready. Say 'Hi ESP' (using the left microphone slot).
Wake word detected. Speak now.
Recording...
Speech started.
Recorded 2.15 seconds.
Uploading 2.15 seconds of audio...
You: What time is it?
Assistant: ...
Playing AI response at 22050 Hz...
Listening for a follow-up...
```

Speak during the follow-up window to continue with the same Ollama history.
After eight seconds without speech it returns to WakeNet and the next wake
starts a fresh history. HTTP failures also safely return it to wake mode.

If the USB port disappears during upload, hold **BOOT**, press and release
**RESET**, release **BOOT**, select the newly appearing port, and upload again.

## Tuning

- Run `speaker_mic_test` first. If its right channel changes when you speak,
  set `MIC_IS_LEFT_CHANNEL` to `false` in the new sketch.
- If recording stops between words, increase `END_SILENCE_MS`.
- If ambient noise prevents recording from stopping, increase
  `SILENCE_THRESHOLD`. If speech is not detected, decrease it.
- The built-in WakeNet model uses **Hi ESP**. A different phrase requires a
  custom WakeNet model; changing a string in this sketch cannot change it.

The buffer holds at most eight seconds of 16 kHz, signed 16-bit mono audio in
PSRAM. It is intentionally not saved to flash or a TF card.
